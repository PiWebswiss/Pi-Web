      <h1>AI Model to classify fossils</h1>
      <p>Identifying fossils can be a time-consuming task that relies on expert knowledge of fossil morphology. This task is particularly challenging due to the often fragmented and degraded nature of fossils.</p>
      <p>The goal of the model is to provide a system that can accurately identify, classify, and recognize fossils based on their images.</p>
      <p>These models are part of my Capstone Project, which you can find on GitHub.<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PiWebswiss/Capstone-Project-Louis-Cavaleri">Capstone-Project</a></p>
      <p>These models were trained on 8,000 images for the fossil vs non-fossil distinction and on 80,000 images across 46 different categories for the fossil classifier. The first model can determine if an image is a fossil or non-fossil with 93% accuracy, while the second has a 90% accuracy rate in identifying specific types of fossils.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that these models are not 100% accurate and have their limitations. For example, the fossil classifier was trained only on 46 different categories, meaning it can classify images only within those predefined categories.</p>
      <p>You can try the model below. The model is loaded and run on your computer.</p>

        <p><strong>Please Note:</strong></p>
        <p>The first time you use this application for inference, it may take a while. This is because the pre-trained models <strong>MobileNetV3Small</strong> and <strong>InceptionV3</strong> are being loaded on your device.</p>
        <p>I've chosen these models for their accuracy and efficiency, but their size means they require some time to become operational.</p>
        <p>This loading process is a one-time event subsequent uses will be much faster. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
